The popular example is Genome Wide Association Studies which focus on (amongst other things) the association of several genes with a known disease type. 1.2 Relationships between \\(\\text{FDR}\\) and \\(\\text{FWER}\\) We note the following 2 key theorems which link \\(\\text{FDR}\\) and \\(\\text{FWER}\\). Theorem 1.1 (FDR = FWER under Global Null) Under the Global Null we have that FDR control is equivalent to FWER control Proof. Under the global null2 we have that all rejections are false rejections i.e. \\(V = R\\). We first consider two cases namely that there are no false rejections \\(V = 0\\) and secondly if there are any false rejections at all i.e. \\(V \\ge 1\\). When \\(V = 0\\) then we have that \\(\\text{FDP} = 0\\) else if \\(V \\ge 1\\) we have that \\(\\text{FDP} = 1\\). So we have that: \\[\\begin{align}\\text{FDR} = \\mathbb{E}\\left(\\text{FDP} \\right) &amp;= (0) \\times \\mathbb{P}(V = 0) + (1) \\times \\mathbb{P}(V \\ge 1) \\\\ &amp;= \\mathbb{P}(V \\ge 1) \\\\ &amp;= \\text{FWER} \\end{align}\\] as required. This now brings us to the following important theorem3: Theorem 1.2 (FWER control always implies FDR control) We always have that \\(\\text{FWER}\\) control implies \\(\\text{FDR}\\) control. Proof. We begin with the simple observation that \\(FDP = \\frac{V}{R} \\mathbb{I}(R &gt; 0)\\). So we always have \\(FDP \\le 1\\) and more specifically we have that \\(FDP \\le \\mathbb{I}(V &gt; 0)\\). Since if \\(V = 0 \\implies FDP = 0 \\le 1\\) and \\(V \\ge 1 \\implies FDP = \\frac{V}{R} \\le 1\\). Taking expectations we have that: \\[\\begin{align*}\\text{FDR} = \\mathbb{E}\\left(\\text{FDP} \\right) &amp;\\le \\mathbb{E}\\left(\\mathbb{I}(V &gt; 0) \\right) \\\\ &amp;= \\mathbb{P}(V \\ge 1) \\\\ &amp;= \\text{FWER} \\end{align*}\\] as required. We’ll come back to sequential testing later↩ i.e. all null hypotheses are assumed to be true↩ In other words \\(\\text{FWER}\\) control is a more conservative method of controlling False Discovery in multiple testing than \\(\\text{FDR}\\) control.↩ "]
