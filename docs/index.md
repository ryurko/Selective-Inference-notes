# Preface {-}

This is a __collection of notes__ on the broad topic of __multiple testing__ and
__selective inference__ by the authors. Think of it like a fun reading group/ survey exercise on these topics.

## Goals {-}

This book differs from other books covering similar material in that
it

* A deeper understanding of __hypothesis testing__ (under both __Bayesian__ and __Frequentist__ perspectives)
* Better understanding of __what selective inference is__ i.e the __mathematical formulation__ and how to __apply it on real data__. Specifically understanding what actual "inference" we are making
* Read more FDR/ multiple testing / selective inference papers and understand __key ideas__, and also __cover proof techniques__
* Read such FDR/ multiple testing / selective inference papers and do a __simulations to to reproduce the papers__.
