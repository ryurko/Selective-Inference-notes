abstract = {Summary We consider a multiple-hypothesis testing setting where the hypotheses are ordered and one is only permitted to reject an initial contiguous block of hypotheses. A rejection rule in this setting amounts to a procedure for choosing the stopping point k. This setting is inspired by the sequential nature of many model selection problems, where choosing a stopping point or a model is equivalent to rejecting all hypotheses up to that point and none thereafter. We propose two new testing procedures and prove that they control the false discovery rate in the ordered testing setting. We also show how the methods can be applied to model selection by using recent results on p-values in sequential model selection settings.}

 abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},
